#UK2000 Homepage - First ever project containing basic HTML and CSS
This is a project I made at the beginning of 2017. It is the first out of 5
projects I am yet to make including advanced languages.

www.UK2000scenery.com is a legitimate website/business which offers cheap UK airport
sceneries for FSX and Prepar3D in awesome quality. However from what I've seen it
lacks a good, modern, professional looking website which currently exists since 2003.
Made by CoffeeCup Visual Site Designer, instead of a web developer :(
And has not been renewed. This is where I came in and created this to at least replace
the disgusting homepage of the UK2000 website but got rejected after having sent
a kind detailed email to the CEO.

This is a webpage that I have created with only HTML & CSS.
